Web Developer and Designer, experienced in SEO, security, UX, and data analytics, seeking new opportunities

For the last 8 years, I worked (and eventually managed) with a fantastic team at Best Online Universities, LLC, where I started out as a Web Developer and moved up to Chief Operating Officer. I tackled a wide-range of issues related to the design, development, and management of a network surpassing 300 web sites and gave me profound experience in SEO and the online education industry.
